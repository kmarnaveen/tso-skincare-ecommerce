‚úÖ Social Proof: "87% of quiz-takers find their perfect match"

```
‚úÖ Real Customer Stories: Priya (24), Ravi (31), Anjali (28)

### **5. Subscription Psychology for LTV**

#### **üîÑ Never Run Out Again**
```
‚úÖ Convenience Focus: "Auto-refill when running low"
‚úÖ Savings Emphasis: Save 15-20% with subscription
‚úÖ Flexibility Assurance: "Skip anytime" reduces commitment fear
